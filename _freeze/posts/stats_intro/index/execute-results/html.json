Each type serves a specific purpose and provides valuable insights into different aspects of the data. \n\nWhile descriptive statistics provides valuable insights into the basic features of a dataset (@fig-ds), inferential statistics takes it a step further by making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample. This type of statistics involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, among other techniques.\n\nBayesian statistics, on the other hand, provides a framework for updating beliefs about parameters or hypotheses based on new evidence or data. It differs from traditional frequentist statistics in that it incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters being estimated.\n\n![The common metrics of descriptive statistics](statistics-01.png){#fig-ds}\n\nIn future sessions, we will delve deeper into inferential and Bayesian statistics to explore their applications and implications in data analysis. In this blog post, we will focus on descriptive statistics (@fig-ds) and explore the central tendency theorem, as well as the measures of center and dispersion.\n\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics is a branch of statistics focused on summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a clear and understandable way. Its primary aim is to define and analyze the fundamental characteristics of a dataset without making sweeping generalizations or assumptions about the entire data set.\n\nThe main purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide a straightforward and concise overview of the data, enabling researchers or analysts to gain insights and understand patterns, trends, and distributions within the dataset.\n\nDescriptive statistics typically involve measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, mode), dispersion (such as range, variance, standard deviation), and distribution shape (including skewness and kurtosis). Additionally, graphical representations like charts, graphs, and tables are commonly used to visualize and interpret the data.\n\nHistograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots are some examples of widely used graphical techniques in descriptive statistics.\n\n\n## Types of Descriptive Statistics\nThere are two types of descriptive statistics:\n\n1. Measures of Central Tendency\n1. Measures of Dispersion\n\n\n## Central Tendency Theorem\n\nOne of the fundamental concepts in descriptive statistics is the central tendency theorem, which refers to the tendency of data to cluster or disperse around a central value. \n\n\n### Measures of Central Tendency\n\nThe central tendency is defined as a statistical measure that may be used to describe a complete distribution or dataset with a single value, known as a measure of central tendency. Any of the central tendency measures accurately describes the whole data distribution. In the following sections, we will look at the central tendency measures, their formulae, applications, and kinds in depth.\n\n#### Mean\nMean is the sum of all the components in a group or collection divided by the number of items in that group or collection. Mean of a data collection is typically represented as x̄ (pronounced “x bar”). The formula for calculating the mean for ungrouped data to express it as the measure is given as follows:\n\nFor a series of observations:\n\n$$\n\\bar x = \\sum \\frac{x}{n}\n$${eqn-eqn1}\n\n\nWhere,\n\n  + $\\bar x$ = Mean values of the vector\n  + $\\sum x$ Sum of all terms\n  + n number of observations\n  \n\n::: {#exm-mean}\nWeights of 7 girls in kg are 54, 32, 45, 61, 20, 66 and 50.

The mean is the average of all the values in a dataset, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest, and the mode is the value that appears most frequently. -->\n\n\n\n<!-- + The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values, also known as outliers.  -->\n\n<!-- + The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending order. It is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean. -->\n\n<!-- + The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal). -->\n\n<!-- These measures provide different perspectives on the center of a dataset and can help to understand where the bulk of the data is located. For example, if the mean, median, and mode are all close in value, it suggests that the data is symmetrically distributed. On the other hand, if these measures are significantly different, it may indicate that the data is skewed. -->\n\n<!-- ### Measure of Dispersion: -->\n\n<!-- In addition to central tendency, descriptive statistics also includes measures of dispersion, which quantify the spread or variability of a dataset. The two common measures of dispersion are the range and standard deviation. -->\n\n<!-- + The **range** is simply the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. While it provides a simple measure of spread, it is heavily influenced by outliers. -->\n\n<!-- + The **standard deviation** measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. It indicates how much the values deviate from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the values are close to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out. -->\n\n\n## Summary\n\nUnderstanding both central tendency and dispersion is essential for gaining insights into the characteristics of a dataset. Together, these measures can help to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers within the data.\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- require(tidyverse) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n\n<!-- FSA::ChinookArg |>  -->\n<!--   ggplot(aes(x = tl)) + -->\n<!--   geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color = \"black\", fill = \"white\")+ -->\n<!--   geom_density(colour = \"blue\")+ -->\n<!--   geom_freqpoly(aes(y = ..density..), color = \"red\") -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n",
